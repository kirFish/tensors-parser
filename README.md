# tensorsParser

A bit about what's going on

There's a site on the web: 
http://mathpar.ukma.edu.ua/en/welcome.html

A future part of its functionality is this project
This projects covers working with tensors
Using the "Tensorics" java library

It also will have the parser for the 
Input data from the site, so it can be a part of it XD

#This project is now inactive because of change of plans and is published as my public repository just why not

For now, it is just a skeleton of probable library to work with tensors in mathematics but there're a lot of work to do
