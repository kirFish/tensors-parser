# tensorsParser

A bit about what's going on

There's a site on the web: 
http://mathpar.ukma.edu.ua/en/welcome.html

A future part of its functionality is this project
This projects covers working with tensors
Using the Tensorics java library

But it also will have the parser for the 
Input data from the site so it can be a part of it XD
